# ABDM Adapter for UHI

This service acts as an adapter and sits between our components/services and the ABDM servers.
It is essentially a component that forwards requests by including appropriate headers and tokens.

Note: Please run the following to ensure that the husky hooks are setup:

```
npm install
npm run prepare
```
